        My “Knea Yerng” Phone Shop iPad Experience

        They spend insane amounts of money trying to make their shop look good through marketing. However, their warranty service is just terrible. I don’t know who they hired to work in the Warranty & Repair department. Their Warranty & Repair department staff are just bad; they try to avoid checking customer products, always claiming it’s a “Software Problem”. Clearly, I can identify what is wrong with the iPad better than their department can.

        Well, I just experienced it myself. I bought an iPad for my brother. It has a hardware problem, but their Warranty & Repair department keeps saying it stems from the software because we updated to the latest version, “18.04”. Well, it's supposed to be a stable version, so why do I have a problem when other people don’t? Clearly, the person I spoke with doesn't even know what he's talking about.

        If you are the owner of the shop, please take some of the budget from the Marketing department and use it to improve your Warranty & Repair department if you want customers to buy your products more than ONE time.
